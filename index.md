## Welcome to Attendy!

Hi! Welcome to Attendy!

This spreadsheet will automatically track attendance for you: <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_kqC3xLnkT3evQBfSx_L7TmtgzeszhXTkMx8hyZRxg/edit?usp=sharing'>Attendance</a><br>

Now how does attendance work? 
Each week students will scan a QR code, which contains a weekly secret password.

To make a QR Code:

Change the KEEP-YOUR-CODE-HERE in this link to the weekly secret password and then display it!

For example, if I wanted to make the password WEEK7 I would write:

https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=MATMSG%3ATO%3Aieor171.berkeley%40gmail.com%3BSUB%3A%3BBODY%3AWEEK7%3B%3B&chs=180x180&choe=UTF-8&chld=L|2

And the QR code would look like this:
