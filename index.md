## Welcome to Attendy!

Hi! Welcome to Attendy! Each week students will scan a QR code, which contains a weekly secret password.
What do you want the password to be this week? 

To make the QR code use this link and change KEEP-YOUR-CODE-HERE to the new password.

For example, if I wanted to make the password WEEK7 I would write:

This is what the code looks like:
